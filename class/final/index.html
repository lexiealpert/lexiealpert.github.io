                    artificial intelligence</p>

                <p> In November of 2022, an artificial intelligence chatbot was released to the public called ChatGPT.
                    Overnight, the popularity of the software exploded- anyone and everyone was using it. </p>
                <p>The question quickly arose: what can't this software do? From writing a 10-page essay on the Great
                    Depression, crafting an email to a boss, or even creating code for an entire website, the
                    possibilities seemed endless. </p>
                <p>Artificial intelligence does not stop at ChatGPT. Instead, it is implemented in aspects of our
                    everyday life. From navigation services to facial recognition, algorithms, and chatbots, the
                    technology is everywhere. </p>
                <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has become so powerful and robust with its capabilities that people are
                    no longer needed to perform specific jobs. <a
                        href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/10/18/how-ai-is-the-new-industrial-revolution/?sh=7fc8361d46e9"
                        style="color: #64a9df;">Forbes Magazine</a> published an article titled "How AI is the New
                    Industrial Revolution," which discusses the new technology's impact.</p>
                <p>However, with the abilities of the newly strengthened AI available comes job loss and no real need
                    for certain employees anymore. </p>

            <h2>Word processors, telemarketers, credit authorizers, file clerks all at risk of job security. </h2>
            <p>Table 1 represents the decrease in demand for specific jobs. At 82.5 percent are computer operators.
                Computer operators are rarely needed because AI software has found ways to run websites entirely by
                robots.
            <p>Telemarketers, credit authorizers, and many different machine operators are also no longer needed due to
                the ability of software to function fully in place of a human operator. </p>
            <p>Many people believe that AI has the potential to destroy certain jobs completely. While this statement
                has a small amount of accuracy, it is still far from the truth. A prime example of this is the creation
                of ATMs. When the ATM was first released to the public in 1970, people predicted that bank tellers would
                no longer be needed. However, this was not the case, rather countries around the world adapted. </p>

                <p>Table 2 lists many occupations that an average person could reasonably believe would be affected by
                    AI. For instance, the first example on this list is interpreters and translators.</p>
                <p>However, because of the large amount of globalization, there is an increased need for translators
                    despite the numerous AI technologies that can translate. </p>
                <p>In addition to this, many jobs are also being created through AI. According to World Economic Forum,
                    machine technology will create 58 million new jobs.</p>
                <p>Table 3 reflects predictions from the World Economic Forum about the present technology and the job
                    opportunities it will create. Big-data analytics is predicted to open up the most opportunities for
                    employment at 59 percent.</p>

                <p>In December of 2022, ChatGPT software had over one million users; by January 2023, ChatGPT had over
                    100 million users. As previously mentioned, the highly advanced technology arose overnight.</p>
                <p>At the University of Maryland, several individuals could be seen using the software on their
