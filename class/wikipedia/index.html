        <section class="intro">
            <p><b>Robyn Rihanna Fenty</b> NH[2] (/riˈænə/ (listen) ree-AN-ə;[3][4][n 1] born February 20, 1988) is a
                Barbadian
                singer, actress, and businesswoman. Born in Saint Michael and raised in Bridgetown, Barbados, Rihanna
                auditioned for American record producer Evan Rogers who invited her to the United States to record demo
                tapes. After signing with Def Jam in 2005, she soon gained recognition with the release of her first two
                studio albums, Music of the Sun (2005) and A Girl Like Me (2006), both of which were influenced by
                Caribbean music and peaked within the top ten of the US Billboard 200 chart.</p>
            <img src="images/wikipedia image - rihanna.png" alt="Wikipedia">
            <p>Rihanna's third album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), incorporated elements of dance-pop and established her
                status as a sex symbol in the music industry. The chart-topping single "Umbrella" earned Rihanna her
                first Grammy Award and catapulted her to global stardom. She continued to mix pop, dance, and R&B genres
                on her next studio albums, Rated R (2009), Loud (2010), Talk That Talk (2011), and Unapologetic (2012),
                the last of which became her first Billboard 200 number one. The albums spawned a string of
                chart-topping singles, including "Rude Boy", "Only Girl (In the World)", "What's My Name?", "S&M", "We
                Found Love", "Where Have You Been" and "Diamonds". Her eighth album, Anti (2016), showcased a new
                creative control following her departure from Def Jam. It became her second US number one album and
                featured the chart-topping single "Work". During her musical career, Rihanna has collaborated with many
                artists, such as Drake, Eminem, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Ne-Yo, and Shakira.</p>
            <p>With sales of over 250 million records worldwide, Rihanna is the second-best-selling female music artist
                of all time. She has earned 14 number-ones and 31 top-ten singles in the US and 30 top-ten entries in
                the UK. Her accolades include nine Grammy Awards, 13 American Music Awards (including the Icon Award),
                12 Billboard Music Awards, six Guinness World Records, the NAACP's President's Award, and an Academy
                Award nomination. Time named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2012 and 2018.
                Forbes ranked her among the top ten highest-paid celebrities in 2012 and 2014. As of 2022, she is the
                wealthiest female musician, with an estimated net worth of $1.4 billion.[5][6]</p>
            <p>Aside from music, Rihanna is known for her involvement in humanitarian causes, entrepreneurial ventures,
                and the fashion industry. She is the founder of the nonprofit organization Clara Lionel Foundation,
                cosmetics brand Fenty Beauty, and fashion house Fenty under LVMH; she is the first black woman to head a
                luxury brand for LVMH.[7] Rihanna has also ventured into acting, appearing in major roles in Battleship
                (2012), Home (2015), Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017), and Ocean's 8 (2018). She was
                appointed as an ambassador of education, tourism, and investment by the Government of Barbados in 2018
                and was declared a National Hero of Barbados on the first day of the country's parliamentary republic in
                2021, entitling her to the style of "The Right Excellent" for life.[2]</p>

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Robyn Rihanna Fenty was born on February 20, 1988, in Saint Michael, Barbados.[8] She is the daughter of
                accountant Monica (née Braithwaite) and warehouse supervisor Ronald Fenty.[9][10] Her mother is an
                Afro-Guyanese, while her father is a Barbadian of African, Irish, English, and Scottish
                descent.[11][12][13][14] Rihanna has two brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty, and two half-sisters and a
                half-brother from her father's side, each born to different mothers from his previous
                relationships.[15][16] She grew up in a three-bedroom bungalow in Bridgetown and sold clothes with her
                father in a stall on the street. Her childhood was deeply affected by her father's alcoholism and crack
                cocaine addiction, which contributed to her parents' strained marriage. Rihanna's father used to abuse
                her mother physically, and Rihanna would try to get in between them to break up fights.[17]</p>
            <p>As a child, Rihanna had many CT scans for the excruciating headaches she suffered, recalling, "The
                doctors even thought it was a tumor, because it was that intense."[15] By the time she was 14, her
                parents had divorced, and her health began to improve.[10][18] She grew up listening to reggae
                music.[15][19] She attended Charles F. Broome Memorial Primary School and Combermere School, where she
                studied alongside future international cricketers Chris Jordan and Carlos Brathwaite.[20][15] As an 11
                year-old, Rihanna was an army cadet in a sub-military programme, where the later Barbadian
                singer-songwriter Shontelle was her drill sergeant.[21][22] Although she initially wanted to graduate
                from high school, she chose to pursue a musical career instead.[23]</p>

            <h2>Music Career</h2>
            <p>In 2003, Rihanna formed a musical trio with two of her classmates in her home country of Barbados.[15]
                Without a name or any material, the girl group auditioned with American record producer Evan Rogers, who
                commented, "The minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn't exist."[15]
                Rihanna went to Rogers's hotel room, where she performed renditions of Destiny's Child's "Emotion" and
                Mariah Carey's "Hero".[24] Impressed, Rogers scheduled a second meeting with Rihanna's mother present
                and then invited Rihanna to his hometown in the United States to record some demo tapes that could be
                sent to record labels.[24] Recordings were intermittent, taking about a year because she was only able
                to record during school holidays. "Pon de Replay" and "The Last Time" were two tracks recorded for the
                demo tape, which were eventually included on her debut album Music of the Sun.[25] That same year,
                Rihanna was signed to Rogers's and Carl Sturken's production company, Syndicated Rhythm Productions.[24]
            </p>
            <p>Rihanna's demo was shipped out to Def Jam Recordings, where Jay Brown, an A&R executive at the record
                label, was one of the first to hear the demo. Brown played the demo tape for rapper Jay-Z, who had
                recently been appointed as president and CEO of Def Jam.[26] When Jay-Z first heard the track "Pon de
                Replay", he felt the song was too big for her.[27] Despite being skeptical, he invited Rihanna to
                audition for the label. In early 2005, Rihanna auditioned for Def Jam in New York City, where Jay-Z
                introduced her to music mogul Antonio "L.A." Reid.[24][28] At the audition, she sang Whitney Houston's
                cover of "For the Love of You", as well as the demo tracks "Pon de Replay" and "The Last Time".[24]
                Jay-Z was absolutely certain about signing her after she performed her future single "Pon de
                Replay".[27] His boss, L.A. Reid, was also impressed with her audition, telling Jay-Z not to let Rihanna
                leave the building until the contract was signed.[29] Reid left it to Jay-Z and his team to close the
                deal which resulted in a six-album record deal with Def Jam. She waited in Jay-Z's office until 3:00 in
                the morning to get lawyers to draft up a contract because he wanted to prevent her from signing with
                another label.[27] Rihanna canceled other meetings with record labels and relocated from Barbados to the
                United States to live with Rogers and his wife.[30]</p>
            <p>After signing with Def Jam, Jay-Z and his team did the A&R for Rihanna's debut album and spent the next
                three months recording and completing her debut album.[29] She worked with different producers to
                complete her debut studio album, primarily Rogers and his production partner Carl Sturken.[31] With
                several songs to pick as a lead single, "Pon de Replay" was chosen because it seemed like the best song
                suited for a summer release.[32] In May 2005, her debut single, "Pon de Replay", was released under her
                mononym "Rihanna". It charted successfully worldwide, peaking in the top five in fifteen countries,
                including at No. 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart.[33] The song became a
                club hit in the United States, peaking at No. 1 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs.[34]</p>
            <p>Music of the Sun was released in August 2005. It debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 and received a
                gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of over
                500,000 units.[35] The album sold over 2 million copies worldwide. A second single, "If It's Lovin' that
                You Want", was not as successful as its predecessor, but reached the top 10 in Australia, Ireland and
                New Zealand.[36] Aside from her work in music, Rihanna made her acting debut in a cameo role in the
                successful straight-to-DVD film Bring It On: All or Nothing, released in August 2006.[37]</p>
            <p>A month after the release of her debut album, Rihanna began working on her second studio album.[38] A
                Girl like Me was released in April 2006.[39] Rolling Stone felt that "the burning rock guitar" and
                haunted strings of some of the album's tracks made "A Girl like Me [...] likable."[40] The album was a
                commercial success, charting in the top 10 in 13 countries. The album reached No. 1 in Canada and No. 5
                in the United Kingdom and the United States, where it sold 115,000 copies in its first week.[35][41] The
                album became Rihanna's first to be certified Platinum by the RIAA, after selling over 1,000,000
                units.[42] Its lead single, "SOS", was an international success, charting in the top five in 11
                countries. The song reached No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and in Australia, her first to reach this
                chart position.[43] "Unfaithful", the album's second single, reached the top 10 in 18 countries,
                including No. 1 in Canada and Switzerland.[44] Two more singles were released from the album: "We Ride"
                and "Break It Off".[45][46]</p>

            <h3>2007–2008: Breakthrough with Good Girl Gone Bad</h3>
            <p>In early 2007, Rihanna appeared on the single "Roll It" with Jamaican band J-Status and fellow Barbadian
                singer-songwriter Shontelle. The song appeared on J-Status' debut album The Beginning, released in
                several European countries only. Around that time, Rihanna had already begun work on her third studio
                album, Good Girl Gone Bad.[47] With the help of producers Timbaland, Tricky Stewart and Sean Garrett she
                embraced a new musical direction through uptempo dance tracks.[48][49] Released in May 2007, the album
                charted at No. 2 in Australia and the US and topped the charts in multiple countries, including Brazil,
                Canada, Ireland and the UK.[50] The album received the most positive critical reviews of her first three
                albums.[51]</p>
            <p>The lead single, "Umbrella", topped the charts in 13 countries and remained at No. 1 in the UK for 10
                consecutive weeks, the longest-running No. 1 single there since Wet Wet Wet's single "Love Is All
                Around" spent 15 weeks at the top in 1994.[52][53] It was Rihanna's first single to be named one of the
                best-selling singles worldwide, with sales of over 8 million copies.[54][55] The songs "Shut Up and
                Drive", "Hate That I Love You" (featuring Ne-Yo), and "Don't Stop the Music" were also released as
                singles, with the latter becoming an international hit. In support of the album, Rihanna began the Good
                Girl Gone Bad Tour in September 2007, with 80 shows across the US, Canada, and Europe.[56] Rihanna was
                nominated for several 2008 Grammy Awards for Good Girl Gone Bad, winning Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for
                "Umbrella" alongside Jay-Z, her first Grammy Award.[57]</p>
            <p>On June 9, 2008, Rihanna released Good Girl Gone Bad Live, her first live long-form video. The DVD and
                Blu-ray release featured Rihanna's concert at the Manchester Arena in Manchester, United Kingdom, held
                on December 6, 2007, as part of the Good Girl Gone Bad Tour. The release also contained a special
                documentary that presented Rihanna discussing her experiences during the tour. By late 2008, Rihanna
                still remained on the charts with the release of the fifth single from Good Girl Gone Bad, "Rehab", and
                was named "Diva of the Year" by Entertainment Weekly for her "newfound staying power".[58] Good Girl
                Gone Bad has sold over 2.8 million units in the United States alone, receiving a two-times-Platinum
                certification from the RIAA. It is Rihanna's best-selling album in the country to date.[35][59] The
                album has sold 9 million units worldwide.[60][61]</p>
            <p>During the late 2000s, Rihanna experimented further with pop, dubstep, and rock music, officially
                shifting her musical style and image away from the Barbados island girl.[62] Throughout 2008, Rihanna
                performed on the Glow in the Dark Tour alongside Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, and N.E.R.D.[63] Her third
                studio album's reissue, Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded, was released in June 2008 with three new songs:
                "Disturbia", "Take a Bow" and the Maroon 5 duet "If I Never See Your Face Again", plus a Spanglish
                version of "Hate That I Love You" featuring Spanish pop singer David Bisbal.[64] All four were released
                as singles and charted highly, reaching peak positions worldwide.[65][66][67] In August 2008, Rihanna
                and a host of other female singers recorded the charity single "Just Stand Up!", the theme song to the
                anti-cancer campaign Stand Up to Cancer.[68] "Live Your Life", a duet between T.I. and Rihanna, was
                released that November and topped the Billboard Hot 100.</p>
